a bit about me:
 - 🪕 I grew up in east Tennessee. My neighbor went to school with Dolly Parton.
 - 🏛️ I learned to code at my local library, and I believe software should help people in poverty get their education for free.
 - 🧠 I've converted every team I've worked on to TypeScript. Currently learning Go!

If you're working on a project that needs a reliable and engaging UI, I'd love to chat! Please feel free to grab a time:
