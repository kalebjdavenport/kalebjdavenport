a bit about me:
 
 - ⚡ Fun facts: I lived on a dairy farm in Tennessee 🐄 and I learned to code at my local library 📖
 - 🆓 I believe software should help people in poverty learn for free 📱
 - 🌱 I’m currently learning Go ![image](https://github.com/kalebjdavenport/kalebjdavenport/assets/40645927/57780ce7-fa40-4bf8-92dc-3b2b021d5a30)
 - 💬 I love to evangelize TypeScript! Ask me about how I've converted my teams to TS 😄
 - ⚽ If you're working on driving product engagement, my favorite thing is to chat about making apps even more fun! Feel free to grab a time on my calendar! https://calendly.com/kalebdavenport
