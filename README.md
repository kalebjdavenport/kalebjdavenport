-->
a bit about me:
 -  Fun facts: I lived on a dairy farm in Tennessee 🐄
 -  I learned to code at my library, and I believe software should help people in poverty learn for free
 -  I’m currently learning Go and I love to evangelize TypeScript! I've converted all my teams to TS
 -  If you're working on a project related to product engagement I'd love to chat! Feel free to grab a time on my calendar:
