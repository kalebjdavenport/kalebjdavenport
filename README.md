a bit about me:
 -  I grew up in east Tennessee, and my neighbor went to school with Dolly Parton.
 -  I learned to code at my library, and I believe software should help people in poverty learn for free.
 -  Iâ€™m currently learning Go and I love TypeScript! I've converted every team I've ever been on to TS, four and counting...
 -  If you're working on a project that needs a reliable and engaging UI, I'd love to chat! Feel free to grab a time on my calendar:
